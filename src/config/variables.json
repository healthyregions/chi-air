Using multiple air quality predictors (such as vegetation, land use, wind speed, temperature, precipitation, aerosol optical depth, point emissions, areal emissions, and more) we estimated PM 2.5 from 2014-2018 at a 1-km resolution using a three-stage model and neural net, replicating previous work and extending it to the local region.
