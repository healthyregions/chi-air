These areas have the lowest housing values in the city but are increasing without a pressing concern for displacement. \n<br/><br/>\nModerate-cost:  Moderate-cost census tracts are areas of displacement due to investment that could be accelerated with initiative (transit, amenities, or high-cost real estate markets). Displacement pressure mostly comes from investors. \n<br/><br/>\nHigh-cost:  High-cost census tracts are areas where displacement is underway and displacement pressure is coming from high-income households and investors targeting households in these areas. These areas represented are characterized by high numbers of vulnerable populations and expensive and rising housing prices.","Data Year":2017,"Data Source(s)":"Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University","Original Scale":"Census Tract","Metadata Doc":"https://ihs-website-v2-production.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/2017/12/18/ihs_mapping_displacement_pressure_in_chicago_technical_2017.pdf","Bins":null,"colorScale":[[100,100,172],[92,108,92],[172,92,92]],"Added By":"Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University","listGroup":"Social","custom":0,"bins":null,"variableName":"Displacement Index"},{"Variable Name":"Economic Hardship Index","Column":"hardship","units":null,"Description":"Economic hardship is measured as a composite index from six measures: unemployment, dependency, education, income, crowded housing, poverty.

These indicators at the census tract level were transformed, normalized into z-scores, and equally weighted to produce a single estimate. A SVI z-score greater than zero indicates an area is more vulnerable on average than half of the tracts in the study area. Thus, areas with higher scores have more vulnerability.\n","Data Year":2018,"Data Source(s)":"CDC","Original Scale":"Census Tract","Metadata Doc":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mj7xu5YS2TNJnDvTfm-A93k9jW5c-jb6UKKJDpdpq7E/edit","Bins":null,"colorScale":[[0,68,27],[92,173,101],[214,238,209],[228,210,230],[154,109,170],[64,0,75]],"Added By":"HeRoP Lab, UChicago","listGroup":"Social","custom":0,"bins":null,"variableName":"Social Vulnerability Index"}]
