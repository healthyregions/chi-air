# ChiVes: The Chicago Environment Explorer
### [ChiVes](https://chichives.com/) is a data collaborative and community mapping application that brings data on Chicago’s environment together at the neighborhood level.


# About

Chicago's urban environment has profound impacts on the health of communities and individuals. A handful of key metrics―tree cover, air pollution estimates, heat island effects, traffic volumes, and social vulnerability index― help to reveal where in the city people face particular challenges as we work towards a healthier Chicago.

ChiVes is a data collaborative and community mapping application that brings data on Chicago’s environment together at the neighborhood level. It’s a partnership of researchers, community organizations, and civic groups. With ChiVes, we harmonize & standardize environmental data across dozens of sources to make it accessible for full exploration, alongside a growing list of resources on the Chicago Environment, cultivated by a community of curators.

This project refactors data from the a previous partnership with the City of Chicago, and gets customized as a new opensource platform for the wider community.

## A Project from the Healthy Regions & Policies Lab

This project is brought to you by the [Healthy Regions & Policies Lab (HeRoP)](https://herop.ssd.uchicago.edu/) at the [Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago](https://github.com/GeoDaCenter). HeRoP integrates innovative GIScience, public health, and statistical approaches to explore, understand, and promote healthy regions and policies. Our group is dedicated to Open Science and open source methodology & applications. We are committed to research translation for policy & public use. We’re interested in how place drives, interacts with, and influences health for different people, in different ways. To explore this further, we look at neighborhoods as complex systems with spatial signals that help decode their stories.

[Marynia Kolak](https://github.com/Makosak), [Dylan Halpern](https://github.com/nofurtherinformation), and [Susan Paykin](https://github.com/spaykin) lead the ChiVes project in the current release.

## Get Involved

Have data to add? A mapping resource to recommend? We invite you to add more resources to the ChiVes explorer as build out an open data coalition to prepare Chicago for a more resilient future.

Organizations and individuals can participate in ChiVes in multiple ways:

* [Data Collaborative](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdu5zCJcvLXp8eY0p3jLuCWPKSuGHjrw2auO3BsD57ssH4_wA/viewform). Integrate your data directly. Members agree that the final, integrated data will meet Collaborative standards.
* [Resource Guide](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2gHSB7OKCKEBhB0weIM7ZsRBomVOAl7QhDHOeXu5B7ih_bQ/viewform). Share your web-based or print media resource on the Chicago environment. Resources must meet ChiVes standards.
* [Web Development](https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/chicago-environment-explorer). Developers and code-enthusiasts can fork the ChiVes website, make changes, and submit for review.

View our [Standards and Submission Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12lwkCAXxI9eW4Mdf6gaeR6LCsaNI3E0E6xvi7dqXr9k/edit?usp=sharing) for more information. These guidelines are evaluated on a regular basis by members of the Data Collaborative.

# Using Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn build:data`

Fetch and build relevant data. You must run this prior to development. 

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
